# Mine→Verify→Cover — automation design (Pass-4 method layer, substrate-agnostic)

**Status:** Design — not yet bound to a substrate. The standalone-vs-VWH-flavor binding (§7) is
**deferred to step #1** (the VWH engine probe) + the step #4 comparison.
**Date:** 2026-06-14
**Inputs (proven):** [`mine-verify-pilot-method.md`](mine-verify-pilot-method.md) (the method + 2 failure
modes + 2-class calibration), [`mine-verify-pass3-evaluation.md`](mine-verify-pass3-evaluation.md)
(GO verdict + tuned gate params + the cost problem),
`sprint-rituals/docs/proposals/br-coverage-loop-harness.md` (the committed full plan: language-neutral
core + adapter, 5-gate battery, KB ledger, stopping signals).

## What this doc is (and isn't)

It is the bridge from the **manually-proven** Mine→Verify→Cover loop (2 classes, recall 3/3) to an
**executable controller** — the Pass-4 "Automate" row of the roadmap. It specifies the deterministic
orchestrator, the agent roles, their I/O contracts, the clean-room *mechanism*, and — the load-bearing
new piece — the **verifier cost fix**. It is written host-neutral so it binds to either a standalone
Workflow script or a VWH flavor; that choice is §7 and stays OPEN until #1 reports.

It is **not** a re-derivation of the loop's research basis (that's the harness-plan proposal) and it does
not start the build (constraint: wait for #1's substrate verdict).

## 1. Loop controller (deterministic orchestrator + clean-room agents)

The split that makes the loop honest: a **trusted orchestrator** holds every privilege; **clean-room
agents** see source only. The orchestrator never mines or verifies (it is contaminated by golden-set
visibility) and no agent ever scores itself.

```
ORCHESTRATOR (trusted, deterministic) — the controller
  • selects next target class from the KB index / worklist
  • dispatches clean-room agents with a RESTRICTED INPUT SURFACE (§3)
  • computes consistency + scores recall/precision vs golden (agents never do)
  • runs the 5-gate battery at Cover acceptance (§6)
  • writes/gates the KB ledger + index (§5); owns stopping signals (below)
  • holds loop state: dry counter, mutation ratchet, budget, per-rule dead-ends

  per target class, one pass:
  ┌─ MINE ──────────┐   ┌─ VERIFY ────────┐   ┌─ COVER ─────────┐   ┌─ DISCOVER ──────┐
  │ N clean-room    │──▶│ triage → scoped │──▶│ TDD + Stryker   │──▶│ boundary anal.  │──┐

  │ complexity      │   └─────────────────┘   └─────────────────┘   └─────────────────┘  │
  └─────────────────┘            │ low-consistency / contradiction → human queue         │
        ▲                        └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        └──── candidate BRs re-enter at Mine (no discovery skips Verify) ─────────────────┘
```

**Phase agents and their contracts** (every deliverable is a **file write** — §4):

| Agent | Count | Input surface | Output file | Privilege limits |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Miner | 1 pure-function / 3 branching-or-stateful (Pass-3 tuned) | source file + Roslyn evidence slice ONLY | `mined-{class}-{i}.md` | no read of `docs/audit/`, `docs/kb/`, test projects |
| Verifier | 1, distinct base model (Codex) | source + mined rules (scoped subset, §2) | `verify-{class}.md` | clean of golden set; refutation/collaborative framing |
| Cover | 1 | source + verified KB rules + surviving-mutant list | tests + `cover-{class}.md` | **no write** to stryker-config / gate infra (§6) |
| Discover | 1 | source + verified rules | `discover-{class}.md` (candidate BRs) | clean of golden set |

**Stopping — external signals only** (orchestrator-owned, no LLM self-assessment anywhere):
- **Dry counter:** 3–5 consecutive passes with zero net-new verified rules.
- **Hard budget cap:** tokens + wall-time ceiling (deployed loops converge in ~5 passes; cap ~20).
- **Mutation ratchet:** suite mutation score never regresses — a regression means the harness is
  broken → halt, don't continue.

## 2. The cost fix (the load-bearing Pass-4 requirement)

Pass-3's single blocker: Codex wall-time scaled 13 min → 48 min with rule count × samples, and won't run
across ~10 classes. The fix is **three composable mechanisms**, all orchestrator-driven:

1. **Triage before refute.** A cheap/deterministic pass classifies each mined rule:
   - **Transcribed** (a formula lifted verbatim from code — band math, `Σbug/Σtotal`) → the verbatim
     quote already entails it; **skip the expensive refuter**, accept on quote-entailment alone.
   - **Interpretive** (guard reachability, branch discontinuity, aggregation semantics, case-sensitivity
     asymmetry, "never reaches 100 within band") → these are where refutation earned its keep in the
     pilot (every real catch was interpretive). **Only these reach Codex.**
2. **Per-rule (or per-cluster) parallel verify** — replace the one monolithic 28-rule pass with a fan-out
   so wall-time ≈ slowest single rule, not the sum. This is the biggest lever.
3. **Tier the verifier** — a cheap model carries the bulk consistency/entailment check; Codex is reserved
   for low-consistency or interpretive rules. Escalation target ~14% (Pass-3 observed) → most rules never
   touch the expensive tier.

**Spike result (2026-06-14, BugRatioCalculator — 3 miners + 35 parallel verifiers).** Recall held **3/3**
vs golden (GOLD-16/17/18); 46 consensus rules, 38 unanimous, 0 contradictions; verify 33 confirmed / 2
imprecise / 0 wrong. Triage worked — 11/46 rules were transcribed and skipped the verifier (~24% fewer
calls). Parallelism cut **wall-time ~5×** (pilot 48 min → ~9 min) — **but total tokens rose ~6×** (~267k →
~1.58M) because each of the 35 parallel verifiers independently re-read the full 386-line source.

**Correction to the mechanisms above — latency and token-cost are separate axes (the design conflated
them):** per-rule parallel verify (#2) buys *wall-time*, not tokens. To cut tokens it must be paired with
**verifier-input scoping** — hand each verifier the rule's quote + a small surrounding slice, *never* the
whole file — and the tiering of #3 (cheap model for the bulk). At ~1.58M tokens/class, ×10 classes ≈ 16M
tokens: token cost is now the load-bearing viability risk, the way wall-time was at Pass 3. Recall at 3/3
is not the constraint; per-class token cost is.

**Spike v2 (sliced input, same 35-way fan-out) — confounded, but decisive on the shape.** Recall held 3/3
(cached mined set). Slicing directionally cut verify tokens (963k vs v1's ~1.4M verifier portion), but the
run exposed two failures that reshape the design: (a) **35 simultaneous verifier calls tripped a server-side
rate limit** — 19/35 errored out and the retries polluted the token count, so parallelism has an
operational ceiling independent of tokens; (b) sliced verifiers flagged **IMPRECISE more often** (5/16 vs
2/35) — a thin slice starves the refuter of context.

**Conclusion — the verifier should be BATCHED, not fanned out per rule.** Cluster ~5 interpretive rules +
their slices into one call (≈7 calls for ~35 rules), not 35 singletons and not one monolith. Batching
dodges the rate limit (few calls), cuts tokens (one context load per batch, not per rule), and gives the
refuter enough surrounding code to judge. So the corrected cost fix is: **triage (skip transcribed) →
slice the source once → batched sliced verify (~5 rules/call) → tier the model for the bulk.** Per-rule
fan-out is the wrong shape on both axes; the monolith is token-cheap but serial; a handful of medium
batches is the sweet spot. (Clean per-class token number still pending a v3 batched run.)

## 3. Clean-room as a mechanism, not a prompt

Prompts are advisory on background subagents (nexus ADR-13) — "don't read the golden set" is not
enforcement. The boundary must be a **capability restriction**:

- Miner/verifier/discover agents run with an **input surface restricted to the source file + Roslyn
  slice** — `disallowedTools` / path-scoped read so `docs/audit/golden-set.md`, `docs/kb/`, and test
  projects are *unreadable*, not merely off-limits.
- **Orchestrator-scores-only:** the golden set is visible to exactly one actor (the orchestrator), which
  never mines. Recall/precision is computed after the fact, against output the miner could not have
  shaped to the key. This is the contamination fix from the pilot, made structural.

## 4. Pilot return-contract fixes (carry forward verbatim)

Two failure modes from the manual runs, now design invariants:

- **Deliverable = a file write, never the final message.** `general-purpose`/Codex agents returned bare
  "Done." with output discarded. Every agent `Write`s (or `cat`-heredocs, for Bash-only bridges) to a
  named file; the orchestrator reads the file. This also makes the pipeline **resumable** — each phase's
  artifact is durable.
- **Confidence = semantic consistency across the N samples, computed by the orchestrator.** Never
  verbalized H/M/L, never CoT-derived (ECE ≈ 0.10 overconfidence). The orchestrator does set-agreement
  over rule statements across miners; all-samples-agree + survives refutation + no contradiction → auto;
  else → human queue.

## 5. KB ledger write (project schema)

Output binds to the *consuming project's* schema (`sprint-rituals/docs/kb/_schema/entry-template.md`:
Rules / Key Files / Edge Cases / Relationships / Source + mutation-tracking HTML comments) — **not** the
harness-plan's aspirational rich frontmatter. The instance KB is sprint-rituals'; the method is nexus'.

- **`index.md` is load-bearing** — a row is added before the KB file, and the index is the authoritative
  worklist Cover reads. First artifact touched, last updated, every pass.
- **Supersession, not deletion** — a corrected rule supersedes; history is preserved.
- Status ladder is mechanical: `verified` (Mine→Verify passed) → `mutation-gated` (Stryker killed ≥1
  mutant per rule). The footer comments (`mutation-gated`, `last-stryker-run`) are flipped by Cover.

## 6. Gates (honesty battery + reward-hacking defense)

Adopt VWH's 5-gate forms at Cover acceptance, enforced **mechanically** (not by agent self-report):

| Gate | Checks | Note for this flavor |
|---|---|---|
| `suite_green` | all tests pass, both double-runs | — |
| `no_flaky` | identical pass/fail counts across the two runs | — |
| `mutation_floor` | sampled kill-rate ≥ floor per pass; full-scope at certify | the BR acceptance gate; `break-at` 70→75→80 |
| `no_new_skips` | skip count ≤ baseline | catches "skip the failing test" hacking |
| `char_pin` | prod-source-touch proxy | **caveat:** VWH's is a count proxy, not a manifest pin — a real char-pin must be reimplemented for the BR flavor |

**Reward-hacking defense (non-negotiable):** the Cover agent gets **no write access** to the Stryker
config, the gate infra, or the KB schema. Coverage is *never* an acceptance criterion anywhere (it is
informational — coverage-gated generation validated bugs in the research). A test that fails on current
code is **not discarded** — it routes to the human queue as a candidate bug.

## 7. Substrate binding — OPEN (decided after #1)

The architecture above is host-neutral. Two candidate hosts; the choice is the output of the #1 engine
probe + #4 comparison, on these criteria: cost/class under the §2 fix, how much of the §6 battery the host
enforces mechanically, fidelity on a real multi-project CPM solution, and how cleanly the orchestrator's
trusted/clean-room split maps.

| Design element | Bind as **standalone Workflow** | Bind as **VWH flavor** |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator (§1) | the JS workflow script — deterministic control flow, `pipeline()` for the per-class loop | VWH kernel's experiment loop (`harness step`, commit-per-experiment) |
| Clean-room agents (§3) | `agent(..., {agentType, disallowedTools-equiv})`, schema-validated returns | flavor's worker invocation under VWH's firewall/editable surface |
| Cost fix parallelism (§2) | `parallel()` / `pipeline()` per-rule fan-out — native fit | flavor's per-experiment fan-out (kernel is more serial) |
| 5-gate battery (§6) | re-implemented in-script (the gates are not provided) | **already exists** (`measure.py:170-181`) — strongest argument for VWH |
| Stopping signals (§1) | script-owned counters + budget cap | VWH's score/ratchet + experiment cap |
| Scoring vs golden (§3) | orchestrator step, golden read in-script | flavor `score()` = recall-vs-golden + mutation-kill-of-verified |

**Leading tension:** the standalone Workflow is the more natural fit for the trusted-orchestrator +
per-rule-parallel shape (the cost fix is `pipeline()`-native); VWH's pull is that it *already ships* the
mechanical gate battery and the commit-per-experiment honesty record. #1 tells us whether VWH's engine
holds up on a real CPM closure (the vendored-slice probe) and at what cost — that result, against the §2
projected cost here, decides it. See `br-coverage-vwh-evaluation.md §6` for the original criteria and
`§Boundary & sequencing` for the three-layer split (method → nexus; instance → sprint-rituals; loop
orchestration → host).

## Rejoin point

Tracks #1 (VWH probe, running) and #2 (this design) converge at **#4 — compare**: VWH's measured
engine numbers (coverage %, mutation kill %, 5 gates, tokens, wall-time on the vendored BugRatio slice)
against this design's §2 projected cost and §6 gate coverage. That comparison resolves §7 and unlocks the
executable build.

# Domain Patterns

DDD building blocks for the domain layer. Two stack variants recur and are called out per pattern:

- **Light stack** — FastEndpoints events, no MediatR, no ASP.NET Core Identity. Domain events extend FastEndpoints `IEvent`.
- **Full stack** — MediatR `INotification`-based events, optional ASP.NET Core Identity.

Pick the variant from the service's CLAUDE.md; the patterns below are otherwise stack-agnostic. Examples name a concrete type only to make a shape legible — substitute your own.

## AggregateRoot

**File:** `src/BuildingBlocks/Blocks.Domain/Entities/AggregateRoot.cs`

- Extends `Entity<TPrimaryKey>`, adds audit fields:
  - `CreatedById (string?)`, `CreatedOn (DateTime?)`, `LastModifiedById (string?)`, `LastModifiedOn (DateTime?)`
- Private `_domainEvents` list exposed as `IReadOnlyList<IDomainEvent>`
- Methods: `AddDomainEvent()`, `ClearDomainEvents()`
- Convenience form: `AggregateRoot` (non-generic, PK = int)

> **Identity-model variant.** Two coherent shapes — choose per service:
> - **Plain-DDD identity (light stack):** `User : Entity<int>` — a plain DDD entity, NOT `IdentityUser<int>`; no ASP.NET Core Identity packages. Use when an external provider (e.g. Google) is the identity authority and roles are string claims.
> - **ASP.NET Core Identity:** extend `IdentityUser<int>` and implement `IAggregateRoot` manually to satisfy the Identity package constraint. Use only when the service actually adopts ASP.NET Core Identity.
>
> Whichever a service picks, record it as a locked decision in that service's CLAUDE.md so features don't drift between the two.

## Entity

**File:** `src/BuildingBlocks/Blocks.Domain/Entities/Entity.cs`

- `Entity<TPrimaryKey>` with `Id` property and equality by ID
- `IsNew` returns true when ID is default value
- Transient entities (both `IsNew`) are never considered equal
- **Encapsulating an entity's setters?** Do not write `required` + `private set` together — that is a CS9032 compile error (a `required` member must be at least as visible as its setter). For an entity whose behavior methods mutate the property after construction (e.g. an `UpdateFromGoogle`-style method), drop `required` and add a private constructor (the factory is then the only construction path, making `required` redundant); use `init` only when nothing mutates it post-construction. Full rule + remedies: `conventions/csharp.md` → Type Conventions.

## Value Objects

**File:** `src/BuildingBlocks/Blocks.Domain/ValueObjects/`

Three base types:
- `ValueObject` — multi-property, implements `GetEqualityComponents()`
- `StringValueObject` — single string `Value`, full equality (`Equals`, `==`/`!=`, `GetHashCode`)
- `SingleValueObject<T>` — single struct `Value`; `Equals(object?)` compares against another `SingleValueObject<T>` of the **same concrete type** (runtime type check via `GetType()` — not a general boxed-T comparison)

Pattern: static `Create()` factory with validation, internal constructor:
```csharp
public class EmailAddress : StringValueObject
{
    internal EmailAddress(string value) { Value = value; }
    public static EmailAddress Create(string value)
    {
        Guard.ThrowIfNullOrWhiteSpace(value);
        return new EmailAddress(value);
    }
}
```

**Per-bounded-context duplication is intentional.** Each service defines its own VOs even if the shape is identical. This follows DDD — each BC owns its types. Only share VOs through BuildingBlocks when they are truly cross-cutting (e.g., `SingleValueObject<T>` base).

### When to Use a Value Object vs a Flat Scalar

**Rule:** When two or more scalar fields are *cohesive* — always used together, share an invariant, or represent one concept — group them into a value object or owned type rather than flat scalars. A single standalone scalar with its own validation or identity (e.g. `EmailAddress`) is also a VO. A single incidental scalar (a count, a flag, a timestamp with no invariant) stays a plain property.

**Worked example (illustrative).** A plain settings class (not an aggregate) that carries a mix of flat scalars and cohesive config VOs demonstrates the rule. Cohesive groups extracted as VOs:

| VO (example) | Cohesion reason |
|------------------------|----------------|
| `HealthThresholdConfig` | Completion/Disruption/CarryOver Green+Amber pairs always set together |
| `HealthWeightConfig` | Completion/Disruption/CarryOver weights sum to 100 — invariant group |
| `QaHealthThresholdConfig` | Coverage/Execution/PassRate threshold pairs |
| `QualitySubScoreWeightConfig` | CoverageWeight/PassRateWeight sum to 100 |

These extend `ValueObject` directly and are mapped via EF `OwnsOne(..., b => b.ToJson())`. Remaining incidental scalars on the settings class (a standalone alert threshold, a feature flag) stay flat — they carry no shared invariant, so a VO would add ceremony without protecting anything.

**Persistence:** Cohesive VOs map via EF Core `OwnsOne` (JSON columns) or `ComplexProperty` (flat columns) — see `persistence-patterns` for the config patterns. Do not restate EF config here.

## Partial Class Behavior Split

All services split aggregate state from behavior:
- `{Aggregate}.cs` — properties, backing collections
- `Behaviors/{Aggregate}.cs` — domain methods that mutate state and raise events

Backing collection pattern:
```csharp
private readonly List<LineItem> _lineItems = new();
public IReadOnlyList<LineItem> LineItems => _lineItems.AsReadOnly();
```

Behavior method convention — **action parameter is typically last.** Prefer action last when writing new code:

```csharp
// action last (preferred convention) — illustrative; substitute your own types
public void AssignTo(Assignee assignee, IAction action)
{
    // validate
    // mutate state
    AddDomainEvent(new AssigneeChanged(this, action));
}
```

Simpler services often need no action object — a plain notification record is enough:
```csharp
public sealed record UserCreated(int UserId) : IDomainEvent;
public sealed record PersonCreated(int PersonId) : IDomainEvent;
```

## Domain Events

**Light-stack interface (`Blocks.Domain/Events/IDomainEvent.cs`):**

```csharp
public interface IDomainEvent : IEvent;
```

`IDomainEvent` extends FastEndpoints `IEvent` only — **no** MediatR `INotification`, so the light stack takes no MediatR package dependency.

**Event record pattern:**
```csharp
// Simple notification — aggregate reference only
public sealed record SprintSynced(Sprint Sprint) : IDomainEvent;

// With data payload
public sealed record PersonCreated(int PersonId, string Email) : IDomainEvent;
```

> **Full-stack variant (MediatR):**
> In MediatR-based services, domain events extend both `INotification` and a base `DomainEvent<TAction>` record:
> ```csharp
> public abstract record DomainEvent<TAction>(TAction Action) : IDomainEvent
>     where TAction : IDomainAction;
> public record OrderApproved(Order Order, IOrderAction Action) : DomainEvent<IOrderAction>(Action);
> ```
> This adds MediatR's `INotification` to `IDomainEvent` so events route through `INotificationHandler<T>`. Use only when the service has MediatR wired.

## Event Dispatch

**Standard interceptor** — `DispatchDomainEventsInterceptor` in `Blocks.EntityFrameworkCore/Interceptors/`:

```csharp
// Registered in {Module}.Persistence/DependencyInjection.cs
services.AddScoped<ISaveChangesInterceptor, DispatchDomainEventsInterceptor>();
```

- Dispatches **after** `SaveChanges` completes (non-transactional)
- Scans `ChangeTracker` for `IAggregateRoot` entries with pending events
- Clears events then calls `IDomainEventPublisher.PublishAsync`
- Registered alongside `IDomainEventPublisher` in the module's Persistence DI

> **Transactional variant.** Some services also ship a `TransactionalDispatchDomainEventsInterceptor` that wraps save + dispatch in a single DB transaction (for handlers that write back to the same DbContext). Add it only when a service needs that guarantee; otherwise the standard interceptor is the default.

## IDomainEventPublisher — Framework Variants

**Light-stack variant (FastEndpoints):**

| Implementation | Location | Mechanism |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| `Blocks.FastEndpoints/DomainEventPublisher` | `src/BuildingBlocks/Blocks.FastEndpoints/` | `domainEvent.PublishAsync(Mode.WaitForAll, ct)` → `IEventHandler<T>` |

Register in the module's Persistence `DependencyInjection.cs`:
```csharp
services.AddScoped<IDomainEventPublisher, DomainEventPublisher>();
```

`IEventHandler<T>` implementations live alongside their feature slices in `{Module}.API/Features/`. Check the service's CLAUDE.md for the exact location.

> **Full-stack variant (MediatR):**
> MediatR-based services use `Blocks.MediatR/DomainEventPublisher`:
> ```csharp
> public sealed class DomainEventPublisher(IMediator mediator) : IDomainEventPublisher
> {
>     public Task PublishAsync(IDomainEvent @event, CancellationToken ct = default)
>         => mediator.Publish(@event, ct);  // routes to INotificationHandler<T>
> }
> ```
> Register in the Application layer's `AddApplicationServices`. Use only when the service has MediatR wired.

## State Machine Pattern

Two location variants — choose based on whether the project has an Application layer:

**Full-stack variant (with Application layer):**

**File:** `src/Services/{Svc}/{Svc}.Application/StateMachines/`

- `{Aggregate}StateMachineFactory` registered as delegate factory — avoids injecting into aggregates
- Validates stage transitions via transition table stored in DB (`{Aggregate}StageTransition`)
- Called in aggregate behavior methods before state mutation
- Per-service `{Aggregate}ActionType` enum defines allowed actions
- Registered in `AddApplicationServices` in the Application layer

**Light-stack variant (no Application layer):**

When there is no Application layer, state machine factories live in the module's API or Domain composition instead. Register them in the module's `AddApiServices` or alongside the relevant aggregate's DI wiring. See `service-registration` for the layer structure without an Application project.

The pattern is the same regardless of layer: DB-stored transition rules + factory-provided validator + aggregate-enforced invariants.

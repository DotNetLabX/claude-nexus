name: create-feature
description: Creates a complete feature slice — the endpoint file, the command or query file holding the request, its reply and its validator, the handler where the service uses a mediator, hand-written mapping, and registration — in either endpoint style (FastEndpoints, or a mediator with minimal or Carter endpoints). Use when adding an endpoint or a feature slice to a service; the service's CLAUDE.md names its one endpoint framework.

# Create Feature

Creates one feature slice: a folder per operation holding the endpoint and its command or query. Two endpoint
styles exist, and a rule that belongs to one of them says so:

- **FastEndpoints** — the endpoint class carries the logic in `HandleAsync`; no mediator, no handler class.
- **A mediator with minimal or Carter endpoints** — the endpoint sends the command to a handler in the
  Application project.

## Assumes

- **The service's `CLAUDE.md` names its one endpoint framework** — FastEndpoints, Carter or minimal APIs — and the
  service uses only that one.
- **A validation library** — FastEndpoints' `Validator<T>` or FluentValidation's `AbstractValidator<T>` — so every
  input has a validator that runs before the logic.
- **One central error mapper** turns errors into replies, so an endpoint never catches to build a reply. Where the
  repo has none yet, `error-handling` carries its sample; build it once under Look First below.
- **A repository with throwing lookups** (`GetByIdOrThrowAsync`) — `persistence-patterns` carries the base
  class's sample.
- No shared library, building block or module layout is assumed: every helper a sample here calls is named by its
  job and has a sample in the skill that owns it.

#### Look First

Before building anything a skill relies on — a guard helper, the central error mapper, a settings binder, an
aggregate or repository base, a save interceptor, an event publisher — look at what the repo already has: first
`project-lists.md` § Helpers, then the shared libraries, modules and packages the project can reach (its project
references and the central package file). Use what you find. Only otherwise build it once, in the shared place: the
lowest project every user of it already references; in a repo of one project, a `Shared` folder in it; where the
users share no project, a new shared project each of them references, with no reference cycle. Never a copy beside
each user. Add its row to `project-lists.md` § Helpers in the same change.
<!-- nexus-gen coding-conventions END -->

## Steps

1. **Read the service's `CLAUDE.md` first** — the framework decides the workflow:
   - FastEndpoints → `workflows/EndpointFastEndpoints.md`
   - Carter with a mediator → `workflows/EndpointCarter.md`
   - Minimal APIs with a mediator → `workflows/EndpointMinimalApi.md`
2. **Read one existing feature of the same service** and copy its folder layout and naming.
3. **Write the command or query file** — the request, its reply and its validator (§ Requests, Replies and Names,
   § Validation and Binding; `workflows/Validator.md`).
4. **Write the endpoint file** with the style's workflow.
5. **Mediator style only:** write the handler — `workflows/Handler.md`.
6. **Map by hand** where a reply is built from an entity — `workflows/Mappings.md`.
7. **Register** — FastEndpoints and Carter find their endpoints themselves; a minimal-API endpoint gets one line in
   the API project's endpoint registration (the minimal-API workflow).
8. **Build** — `dotnet build`.

## Feature Folder Structure

A feature is always a folder: one folder per operation, `Features/{Area}/{Operation}/`, holding 1 to 5 files. The
endpoint lives in `{Operation}Endpoint.cs` and holds that one type. The request, its reply and its validator live
together in `{Operation}Command.cs` (a write) or `{Operation}Query.cs` (a read) — always, never inline in the
endpoint file. Pieces several operations of an area share live in that area's `_Shared` folder, which sorts first;
its namespace is `.Shared`. A feature area never references a sibling area, and there is no shared catch-all
folder of features.

FastEndpoints — everything in the API project:

```text
{Svc}.API/Features/{Area}/{Operation}/
├── {Operation}Endpoint.cs      the endpoint and its logic
├── {Operation}Command.cs       the request, its reply and its validator (or {Operation}Query.cs)
└── {Operation}Summary.cs       optional: text for the API reference pages
```

A mediator with minimal or Carter endpoints — the endpoint in the API project, the rest in the Application project:

```text
{Svc}.API/Endpoints/
└── {Operation}Endpoint.cs      sends the command to its handler

{Svc}.Application/Features/{Area}/{Operation}/
├── {Operation}Command.cs       the request, its reply and its validator (or {Operation}Query.cs)
└── {Operation}CommandHandler.cs
```

A type another operation also needs — a `{Thing}Dto`, a base command, a base endpoint — moves to `_Shared` when the
second user appears. A DTO only one reply uses gets its own file in that operation's folder.

## Requests, Replies and Names

- **Names.** Inputs are `{Operation}Command` (a write) or `{Operation}Query` (a read); outputs are
  `{Operation}Response`; a shape several replies share is `{Thing}Dto`. The endpoint class is named for its
  operation, verb first, and equals its folder and its command: `ShipOrder/ShipOrderEndpoint.cs` handles
  `ShipOrderCommand`.
- **Parameter names.** The request parameter is `command` or `query`; no abbreviations (`req`, `cmd`, `res`). The
  one short name is `ct` for the cancellation token.
- **Records.** Requests and replies are records. A request has `init` members, filled by binding; a reply is a
  positional record, built with positional arguments — named arguments only where two neighbouring members have the
  same type and a swap would compile (a choice: positional building is shorter, named arguments are safer there).
- **Create and update reply with the shared id reply.** It is built once, in the shared place:

```csharp file=IdResponse.cs
public record IdResponse(int Id);
```

- **A reply that carries a list is a named record holding the list** — never a bare list and never `object`, so
  the reply can grow (paging, totals) without breaking its readers:

```csharp file=ListOrdersQuery.cs
public record ListOrdersQuery
{
    public OrderStatus? Status { get; init; }

    public int Page { get; init; } = 1;

    public int PageSize { get; init; } = 20;
}

public record ListOrdersResponse(List<OrderDto> Orders, int Total);

public class ListOrdersQueryValidator : Validator<ListOrdersQuery>
{
    public ListOrdersQueryValidator()
    {
        RuleFor(query => query.Status).IsInEnum();
        RuleFor(query => query.Page).GreaterThan(0);
        RuleFor(query => query.PageSize).InclusiveBetween(1, 100);
    }
}
```

- **The command base carries who acts and when.** Every write command derives one base record that names its
  action and holds the acting user and the time. The stamping hook (`authorization-patterns` § Phase 4 — Identity
  stamping — pick by framework) fills those two members from the token and the injected clock; the wire never sets
  them, so they are `[JsonIgnore]` — the one place a request record has a `set`. The domain's behaviour methods take
  the action object (`order.Ship(command.TrackingNumber, command)`), so the interface lives in the Domain project and the base record in
  the features' `_Shared` folder:

```csharp file=IAction.cs
public interface IAction
{
    int ActingUserId { get; set; }

    DateTimeOffset ActedOn { get; set; }

    string ActionName { get; }
}
```

```csharp file=ActionCommandBase.cs
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;

public abstract record ActionCommandBase<TActionType> : IAction
    where TActionType : struct, Enum
{
    [JsonIgnore]
    public abstract TActionType ActionType { get; }

    [JsonIgnore]
    public string ActionName => ActionType.ToString();

    [JsonIgnore]
    public int ActingUserId { get; set; }

    [JsonIgnore]
    public DateTimeOffset ActedOn { get; set; }
}
```

  An area's commands share the route id and its validation through one more base, in the area's `_Shared` folder;
  its file holds the family validator beside it. The samples show the FastEndpoints validator base (`Validator<T>`);
  the mediator style writes `AbstractValidator<T>`:

```csharp file=OrderCommand.cs
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;

public abstract record OrderCommand : ActionCommandBase<OrderActionType>, IOrderAction
{
    [JsonIgnore]
    public int OrderId { get; init; }
}

public abstract class OrderCommandValidator<TCommand> : Validator<TCommand>
    where TCommand : OrderCommand
{
    protected OrderCommandValidator()
    {
        RuleFor(command => command.OrderId).ValidId();
    }
}
```

  The area's action interface lives beside `IAction` in the Domain project, so a behaviour method or a state
  machine guard can read which action it is given (`add-state-machine`):

```csharp file=IOrderAction.cs
public interface IOrderAction : IAction
{
    OrderActionType ActionType { get; }
}
```

```csharp file=ShipOrderCommand.cs
public record ShipOrderCommand : OrderCommand
{
    public required string TrackingNumber { get; init; }

    public override OrderActionType ActionType => OrderActionType.Ship;
}

public class ShipOrderCommandValidator : OrderCommandValidator<ShipOrderCommand>
{
    public ShipOrderCommandValidator()
    {
        RuleFor(command => command.TrackingNumber).RequiredWithMaxLength(MaxLength.Code);
    }
}
```

  The length is the field-length constant the table configuration uses for the same column
  (`create-aggregate` § Field-Length Constants), so a value the validator accepts always fits the table. A shared base validator is named for its family (`OrderCommandValidator<T>`); each command's own validator is
  `{Command}Validator` (`workflows/Validator.md`).

## Endpoint Styles

- **One endpoint framework per service,** named in the service's `CLAUDE.md`. Two frameworks in one service double
  what every reader must know.
- **FastEndpoints:** route, access and tag are attributes on the class, in the order authorization, route, tags;
  the tag is the feature area. `HandleAsync` has a block body. Text for the API reference pages, where an endpoint
  needs any, goes in a `{Operation}Summary` class beside it — never in a comment.
- **Mediator style:** the endpoint builds nothing itself — it sets the route values onto the command with a `with`
  expression, sends it with the token, and returns the reply. Route, access, name and tag are fluent calls on the
  route.
- **No error handling in an endpoint.** It has no `try/catch` that builds a reply and writes no error status by
  hand; a missing entity is thrown by the lookup and turned into a 404 by the central mapper
  (`error-handling` § Prohibitions (load-bearing)).
- **No access check inside an endpoint.** Access is declared on the endpoint (`authorization-patterns`).
- **Endpoints set no response headers and read no settings to branch on.** The one exception: an endpoint that
  streams its reply sets the headers streaming needs.
- **The route prefix and the JSON settings are set once,** in the host's start-up
  (`service-registration` § Program.cs Structure (self-hosted service)); an endpoint declares only the rest of its
  route.
- **Status codes by named constant** (`StatusCodes.Status404NotFound`), never a bare number.

## Validation and Binding

- **Every input has a validator,** route ids included: an id is validated greater than zero.
- **Required members are non-nullable and validated;** a member is nullable only when it is truly optional. Never
  `!.Value` on a request member.
- **Query-string inputs bind into the query record,** with defaults written on its members (`Page = 1`).
- **Every route parameter carries a type constraint** — `{orderId:int}`, `{code:guid}`.
- **Route and query values end up on the command or query record,** never passed on as separate arguments.
  FastEndpoints binds them there; the mediator style copies each route value onto the command once, with `with`,
  before it sends it. An endpoint without a request only where there is truly no input.
- **Validation messages** come from the shared message helpers or constants, never a literal per rule
  (`error-handling` § Validation Messages).

## Route Conventions

- **Resource first, `:verb` for an action.** Writes on a resource use its route (`POST orders`,
  `PUT orders/{orderId:int}`); an action that is not plain create, update or delete appends its verb after a colon
  (`POST orders/{orderId:int}:ship`, `POST orders/{orderId:int}/items/{itemId:int}:return`).
- **A route parameter names its entity and its type** — `{orderId:int}`, never `{id}` beside a second id.
- **A read binds from the query string** (`GET orders?status=Open&page=2`); it has no body. A delete takes its id
  from the route, has no body and replies 204.
- **A route is written as text on its endpoint.** A named constant only when a second place must read the same
  address.
- **Existing routes follow the form too.** Moving a route moves its callers in the same change: the repo's own
  pages and tests, and — where another system holds the address (a webhook, a sign-in return address, a link
  another app opens) — that system's registration. The cost is that one change spans every caller; with no outside
  caller it is small.

## Shared Base Endpoint

Sibling endpoints that share a flow — load the same aggregate, check the same state, reply the same way — inherit
it from a base endpoint in the area's `_Shared` folder, once three siblings share it. Below three, a base class
costs more than it saves: leave the lines in each endpoint. In the mediator style the same rule applies to a base
handler.

```csharp file=OrderEndpoint.cs
public abstract class OrderEndpoint<TCommand>(OrderRepository _orderRepository)
    : Endpoint<TCommand, IdResponse>
    where TCommand : OrderCommand
{
    public override async Task HandleAsync(TCommand command, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var order = await _orderRepository.GetByIdOrThrowAsync(command.OrderId, ct);

        Apply(order, command);

        await _orderRepository.SaveChangesAsync(ct);

        await Send.OkAsync(new IdResponse(order.Id), ct);
    }

    protected abstract void Apply(Order order, TCommand command);
}
```

Logic two endpoints share is not moved into an operation class named `…Service`: the base endpoint (or base
handler) is the place, and a computation over several aggregates is a domain calculator (`domain-service`).

## Anti-patterns

- **Writing code before reading the service's `CLAUDE.md`.** The framework decides the workflow; finding it out
  mid-way means rewriting the endpoint.
- **A layout derived from this skill alone.** Copy the folder layout of an existing feature in the same service.
- **Registering a FastEndpoints endpoint by hand.** It finds its endpoints itself; a manual line routes twice.
- **The request or reply declared in the endpoint file.** The split is mandatory; `extract-endpoint-types` repairs
  a file written before it.
